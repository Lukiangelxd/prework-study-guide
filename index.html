              <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
              <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
              <li>There are both parent and child elements that are found in code. </li>
              <li> The parent element is the one that hold all the elements (Child Elements) nested into one element.</li>
              <li>Its one of three cornerstone languages in web development (HTML, CSS, and JS are the main).</li>
              <li>HTML is made up of elements to provide content and framework to a website.</li>
              <li>Elements refer to the whole element from opening to closing tag.</li>
              <li>Tag refers to what appears inside the brackets of an element.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style sheets which is a programing language.</li>
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, organization and visual layout.</li>
          <li>CSS allows the coders to format in multiple style options.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is a style in which we want to directly style in the HTML file; this is applied to a specific HTML tag and is edited individually.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS is found in the head portion on an HTML file; this helps style multiple elements within a page.</li>
          <li>External CSS is the most common way to style; keeps all rules in a seperate style sheet file to keep the design simple.</li>
          <li> Declarations contain the value and the property of an element such as color (value): blue (property).</li>
          <li>You must place a link piece of code between the style sheet and the assets file in order for style to appear.</li>
