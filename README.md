# Prework-study-guide
## Description

This project's intended use is for the needs of future students who will be learning HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. There are notes that can be found throughout this project and be used as key terms or acknowledgement whilst learning. My motivation for creating this is being a student first-hand and seeing how much this information could have helped me when I first started. I built this project so I could reference it when I hopefully need to teach someone about this information later down the line. The problem its helping me solve currently is understanding code in order to create this project (I'm coding this message currently). The main thing to take away from this is I've learned how to make index.html files and so much more during this project so learning these few terms will help you as you begin your first step into being a web developer.

## Usage

There are several sections that can be looked at (HTML,CSS,Git and Javascrpit) but you should focus on how to apply that information to every day use for studying. For HTML, you can understand that its a markup language made up of elements and uses tags to have things appear inside of brackets. For CSS you can comprhend that its a language that is made for visual layout and for making sure it remains organized. For Git, you can see its an interface used as a virtual storage unit for many web developers when working on code at the same time. Also you will understand that for Javascript you can see its a logical language that brings functionalty to the code.
